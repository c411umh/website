<h1>üë®‚Äçüíª Experience</h1>

<i>SEP 2017 - ONGOING</i>
<h2>Digital Catapult</h2>
<h4>Senior Software Engineer, Advanced Digital Technologies</h4>
<p>
  I joined DC at peak blockchain-hype and worked with a tremendous team
  demystifying various technologies, shifting focus to more tangible results.
  Over the past few years we've brought IoT, AI, Blockchain, and Immersive
  technologies (sometimes in the same project) rapidly to early prototype.
</p>
<p>
  Our 2021 focus is Open-Source-First with an emphasis on scalable architecture.

<h2>Accenture</h2>
<h4>Lead Developer</h4>

  After university I joined the Innovation Programme and quickly earned the Lead

  built prototypes and won a patent covering HSM integration.
