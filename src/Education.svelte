<h4>B.Sc Computer Science (2:1)</h4>

  My dissertation was a health app to aid smoking cessation using ML to predict
  the time/place a user would experience cravings, then use nudge theory to aid
  their resistance.
</p>
<p>
  The app was surprisingly effective, winning a Â£20k grant for NHS research. In
  the summer after graduation I released an improved version to the Play Store
  for free which reached #1 in Health & Fitness, with 50k downloads.
